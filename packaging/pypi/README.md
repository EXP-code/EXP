# EXP PyPi Packages

These directories are not meant to be used directly with `pip install`. Instead,
run `python setup.py sdist` to create a source distribution, then run
`pip install dist/<library>-<version>.tar.gz` to install to your python
environment.

Requirements for individual packages are located in the individual directories.
