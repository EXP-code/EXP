\section atomic Atomic cooling implementation

For code details see \ref ion.

In order to treat the gas properly in a non-thermal way, the gas
cooling must be treated without the use of thermalize cooling curves.
Instead, the atomic cooling must be treated by calculating all
possible interaction cross sections for all collision pairs, and then
using Monte Carlo sampling to determine which interaction the pair
undergoes. The code puts into account the following interactions:

<ul>
<li> Collisional Excitation (CE)   </li>
<li> Collisional Ionization (CI)   </li>
<li> Free-free Bremmstrahlung (FF) </li>
<li> Radiative Recombination (RR)  </li>
</ul>

<h2> %Ion Interface </h2>

The main interface that CollideIon utilizes is the Ion interface. This
class is the direct interface to the CHIANTI database, as well as all
of the cross section formulas. All that is needed to create the ion
interface is a simple statement, like: 

<code>Ion A = new Ion(Z, C) </code>.

It is also designed to accept CHIANTI based atomic strings
(i.e. <code> HII = "h_2"</code>). Once the ion interface is defined
for a give \f$(Z, C)\f$ species, all the calculations can be done within
it. The second interface that must be called (though still part of the
Ion.cc) is the CHIANTI file class chdata, called in the code simple by

<code>chdata ch; </code>

This variable <code>ch</code> then allows access to all the files that
the CHIANTI database has. It is used internally by the Ion class
only. For instance, to get the total free-free cross section, a sample
code is:

<code> double ffcross = A.freeFreeCross(ch, kEe) </code>

where <code>kEe</code> would be the electron interaction energy in
eV. This interface was written to be very modular and easy to modify,
as well as add any possible future interactions such as charge
exchange. All that would be needed is a way to calculate the
interaction cross sections, and have that added into the Ion
interface. All cooling is performed by a separate class called
InteractSelect, discussed a bit below.

<h2>Cross Section Formulas</h2>

The cross sections are calculated using a combination of CHIANTI data
and analytic (or semi-analytic) formulas that use the data from
CHIANTI. The following sections will explain the equations for each of
the cross sections that are implemented, as well as any
approximations. In the code, only electron-ion interactions are
considered since their cross sections are larger by two orders of
magnitude than ion-ion interactions.

<h3>Collisional Excitation</h3>

For collisional excitations, the CHIANTI database includes thermally
averaged cross section strengths. The cross section strengths can be
used as a non-thermal approximation by using the thermal cross section
strengths in the general cross section formula. The relation between
the strengths and cross sections is:

\f[
	\sigma_{CE} = \sum_j \frac{\Gamma_{ij}}{\omega_i k_i^2} 
\f]	 

where \f$\sigma_{CE}\f$ is the total cross section, summing up all
cross sections from the ground level to a higher quantum level
j. \f$\Gamma_{ij}\f$ is the thermal cross section strength between
quantum levels i and j, $\omega_i$ is the statistical weight of level
i, and de Broglie wavelength of the atomic at quantum level i. The
cross section is calculated in units of \f$\pi a_0^2\f$.

The definition of \f$\Gamma_{ij}\f$ is 

\f[ 
    \Gamma_{ij} = \int_0^{\inf} \Omega_{ij} 
    \exp\left(\frac{-E_j}{kT}\right) d\left(\frac{E_j}{kT}\right) 
\f] 

Collisional excitation is the dominant form of cooling from
\f$\approx\f$10,000K up until \f$\approx\f$150,000K from both Hydrogen
excitation (at low temperature end) and Helium excitation at the
higher temperature end.

<br>

<h3>Collisional Ionization</h3>

Collisional ionization is an important cooling channel for
temperatures below \f$\approx\f$ 150,000K. This cross section is
calculated using the scaled cross sections in CHIANTI, in the form
from Burgess \& Tully (1992). These are not thermally averaged, so
remain totally general, relying only on the energy impact of the
electron. The CHIANTI database gives the scaled cross sections as a
function of a scaled energy, the two being defined as:

\f[ U = 1 - \frac{\log f}{\log(u - 1 + f)}\f] 

\f[ \Sigma = \frac{u\sigma I^2}{\log u + 1} \f] 

With \f$f\f$ being an arbitrary parameter, give in CHIANTI, \f$u\f$ is
the impact energy scaled to the ionization energy, \f$I\f$ is the
ionization energy, and \f$\sigma\f$ is the true cross section. All one
needs to do then is to calculate the scaled energy, interpolate to
find the scaled cross section, then descale to get the true cross
section.

<br>

<h3>Radiative Recombination</h3>

While radiative recombination is never a dominant form of cooling, it
is crucial for the equilibrium ionization fractions. Unfortunately,
because radiative recombination is a complicated quantum process there
is no easily calculable non-thermal cross section. Doing so involves
the calculation of wave functions, as well as the final shells of the
recombination. Instead, a thermal approximation for the radiative
recombination is used being the only option besides using thermal
rates. Using the Milne relation in combination with the
photo-ionization cross section of Mewe 1986, an approximate cross
section formula can be derived:

\f[ 

\sigma_{RR} = 1.075812 \cdot 10^{-23} \frac{E^2}{2 m_e c^2 E_e^2}
\frac{\omega_i}{\omega_0} \left(\frac{I}{keV}\right)^2
\left(\frac{keV}{E}\right)^3 \frac{g_{bf}}{n_i} [m^2]

\f]

where \f$E_e\f$ is the electron impact energy, \f$E = E_e + I_j\f$,
\f$I_j\f$ is the ionization energy from level j from CHIANTI,
\f$g_{bf}\f$ is the gaunt factor taken from CHIANTI, \f$n_i\f$ is the
quantum number at state i and \f$\omega\f$ is the statistical weight
of the level.

<br>

<h3>Free-free cross section</h3>

Free-free interactions are only important at high temperatures when
the gas is fully ionized at very hot (meaning no other interaction can
occur). This cross section was taken from Koch (1959). The equation
chosen is valid under these assumptions:

<ol>
<li>Born Approximation holds</li>
<li>Assumes no electron screening</li>
<li>The gas is non-relativistic</li>
</ol>

With these assumptions, the free-free general cross section is written as 

\f[ 
\frac{d\sigma}{dk} = \frac{Z^2 r_0^2}{137} \frac{16}{3} 
		   \frac{1}{k}\frac{1}{p_0^2} 
		   \ln \left(\frac{p_0 + p}{p_0 - p}\right)
\f]

where \f$p\f$ and \f$p_0\f$ are the final and initial electron
momentum respectively.

<h2>%Interaction Selection</h2>

The step of performing the cooling is to determine how many pairs in
the gas will interact. This is calculated simply using

\f[ 
    N_{coll} = \frac{1}{2} n <N> (\sigma_T c_r)_{max} \delta t 
\f]

where n is the local number density, <N> is the average number of
particles in a cell, \f$c_r\f$ is the local relative velocity
magnitude, \f$\delta t\f$ is the time step, and \f$\sigma_T\f$ is the
total cross section. The total cross section used is taken from the
previous time step, using the assumption that the total cross sections
won't change very quickly if the gas is evolved slowly relative to
any thermal time scales. On the first time step, the Bohr cross
section is used for an initial guess. For each pair, the total cross
section is calculated, and all possible cross sections are put into an
array with the interaction cross sections scaled such that the total
cross section is 1 (i.e. an array that might look like [CE 1, FF 1, CE
2, FF 2]. This gives an array for the cumulative cross section in
terms of each component. A random number is drawn from a uniform
distribution between 0 and 1, and using the scaled interaction array,
the cross section is chosen corresponding to the interaction in that
cumulative cross section bin. For instance, an array could look like
[0.25, 0.3, 0.8, 1.0] for the interactions in the last example. If the
random number drawn is 0.75, it would correspond to interaction 3, or
CE 2.

<h2>Cooling Determination</h2>

The actual cooling that happens comes straight forward from the
interaction which takes place. All of the cooling is done through the
class interface InteractSelect. This class has all the cooling
functions for the given interactions. The flexibility that this
creates allows any future interactions to be easily added into the
interface and then a single if statement to be added into the
CollideIon class. It also gives a single class to make any
modifications to the cooling dynamics much more simple. The cooling
processes are for each interaction that contribute are shown in the
list below:

<br>

<h3>Collisional Excitation</h3>

CE process is described by: \f$ \mbox{I} + e^- \rightarrow \mbox{I} +
e^- + E_{ij}\f$ where $\f$E_{ij}\f$ is the energy left to go from the
metastable state of the electron at state j back down to the ground
state for ion I. This energy is removed from the center of mass from
in the atomic reference frame.  This energy is generally fairly high,
since the difference between n = 1 and 2 is ~10 eV. So, even though CE
may not happen as much as other interactions, it's cooling is much
greater

<h3>Collisional Ionization </h3>

Described by \f$ \mbox{I} + e^- \rightarrow \mbox{I}^\ast + 2e^- + \chi
\f$ where the last term is the ionization energy that gets released as
cooling from the center of mass frame and \f$\mbox{I}^\ast\f$ is the
next ionization state of I.

<h3> Free-free </h3>

In this interaction, the electron is just affected by the
electrostatic potential of the charged ion, and during its
acceleration from the potential it releases a small amount of energy
as radiation. This amount of energy is generally very small, therefore
it only dominates in very hot fully ionized plasmas where its the
dominate interaction.

<h2>Electron Treatment</h2>

There are various ways in which the electrons can be treated. In this
version of the code, the electrons are treating as if they were
essentially "stuck" to the ions. This means each DSMC particle is
effectively electrically neutral, allowing for the electrons to only
be put into account by a simple tag. Since the charge of the ion is
already being stored, then in order to assure electronic neutrality,
the number of electrons per ion then must be C-1. The electrons can
then be treated by simple, with no extra memory being needed to put
into account. In this approximation the electrons are essentially
being treated as a cloud, with each DSMC particle having enough
electrons in its volume to make it electrically neutral. However, the
way in which the information on the ions is stored, as well as the
generality and flexibility with the inclusion of the interactions
through the Ion interface it will be fairly simple to add them in free
streaming. The only difficulty comes from doing time stepping criteria
from the difference in velocities between the electrons and ions.

\section milne Radiative Recombination using the Milne relation

We may derive an expression for radiative recombination by noting that
it is the inverse process of photoionization: that is,
\f$\sigma_{fb}\f$ is the cross-section for an ion recapturing its
electron and emitting a photon. We'll use detailed balance in thermal
equilibrium to derive a relationship for \f$\sigma_{fb}\f$ in terms of
\f$\sigma_{bf}\f$. This is called the Milne Relation. Even though our
derivation uses thermal equilibrium, the end result is independent of
thermal equilibrium.

Thermal equilibrium demands that the radiative
recombinations rate equal the photoionization rate. Specifically:
\f[
	\hbox{recombination rate} = n_+ n_e \sigma_{fb}(v)v[f(v)dv] =
	\frac{\hbox{number of recombinations}}{\hbox{volume}\times\hbox{time}}
\f]

The rate of photoionization is
\f[
	\hbox{photoionization rate} = 
	\frac{B_\nu 4\pi d\nu}{h\nu} n_0\sigma _{bf}\overbrace{\left(1-{g_0\over g_+}{n_+\over n_0}\right)}^{
	{
	{\hbox{correction for}\atop\hbox{stimulated}}
	\atop\hbox{recombination}}
	}
\f]
where \f$n_0\f$ is the number density of neutrals. This has units of a
number flux. The cross section \f$\sigma_{bf}\f$ depends on \f$\nu\f$
and \f$n_+/n_0\f$ is evaluated at the relative velocity \f$v\f$ such
that \f$h\nu =\frac12m_e v^2 + \chi\f$, where \f$\chi\f$ is the
threshold ionization energy.

Next, the Boltzmann relation in thermal equilibrium is
\f[
{n_+\over n_0}={g_+\over g_0}e^{-E\over kT}
\f]
where \f$E\f$ is the energy difference between the initial state (proton and
unbound \f$e^-\f$ − ) and final state (bound proton and electron). Thus our
expression for \f$E\f$ becomes
\f[
E=\frac12m_ ev^2-(-\chi )=h\nu
\f]
The appropriate velocity distribution \f$f(v)\f$ for thermal equlibriium is the Maxwellian velocity distribution:
\f[
 f(v)=4\pi \left({m_ e\over 2\pi kT}\right)^{3\over 2}v^2e^{-m_ ev^2\over 2kT}.
\f]
The Saha equation for thermal equilibrium gives us
\f[
{n_+n_ e\over n_0}=\left[{2\pi m_ ekT\over h^2}\right]^{3\over 2}{2g_+\over g_ n} e^{-\chi \over kT}
\f]

Finally, the equality of rates gives
\f[
1={n_+n_ ef(v)v\sigma _{fb}(v)dv\over {4\pi B_\nu \over h\nu }d\nu (1-e^{-h\nu _{21}\over 2kT}) n_0\sigma _{bf}(v)}
\f]
and substituting in all of our thermal equilbrium relations to further 
simplify, we get:
\f[
{{\sigma _{fb}(v)\over \sigma _{bf}(\nu )}= {g_0\over g_+}\left({h\nu \over m_ ecv}\right)^2}
\f]
This result is independent of thermal equilibrium!
