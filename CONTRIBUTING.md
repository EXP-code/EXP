# Contributing to EXP

There are many ways to contribute to EXP. Here are some of them:

-   Blog about EXP. Cite the EXP published papers. Tell the world how
    you're using EXP. This will help newcomers with more examples and
    will help the EXP project to increase its visibility.
-   Report bugs and request features in the [issue
    tracker](https://github.com/EXP-code/EXP/issues), trying to follow
    the guidelines detailed in **Reporting bugs** below.
-   Submit new examples to the [EXP examples
    repo](https://github.com/EXP-code/EXP-examples) or the [pyEXP
    examples repo](https://github.com/EXP-code/pyEXP-examples).

# Stable and development branches

Our current branch policy changed as of May 1, 2023. Rather than a
`main` branch for a stable EXP/pyEXP release with development taking
place on the `devel` branch, the only official EXP branch will be
`main`. All development will take place through a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
to `main`. All other branches are considered to be temporary. The
current stable release will be tagged in the GitHub release menu. The
HEAD of `main` will contain the latest new features and fixes.

# Reporting bugs

Well-written bug reports are very helpful, so keep in mind the following
guidelines when you're going to report a new bug.

-   check the [FAQ](https://exp-docs.readthedocs.io) first to see if
    your issue is addressed in a well-known question
-   check the [open issues](https://github.com/EXP-code/EXP/issues)
    to see if the issue has already been reported. If it has, don't
    dismiss the report, but check the ticket history and comments. If
    you have additional useful information, please leave a comment, or
    consider sending a pull request with a fix.
-   write **complete, reproducible, specific bug reports**. The smaller
    the test case, the better. Remember that other developers won't
    have your project to reproduce the bug, so please include all
    relevant files required to reproduce it.
-   the most awesome way to provide a complete reproducible example is
    to send a pull request which adds a failing test case to the EXP
    testing suite. This is helpful even if you don't have an
    intention to fix the issue yourselves.
-   include the output of `exp -v` so developers working on your bug
    know exactly which version and platform it occurred on, which is
    often very helpful for reproducing it, or knowing if it was already
    fixed.

# Contributing to code development

We are now using the [pull
request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
method for all EXP development, in including the code authors and
maintainers. In essence, a pull request is code patch that allows us
to easily review, test, and discuss the proposed change. The better a
patch is written, the higher the chances that it'll get accepted and
the sooner it will be merged.

Well-written patches should:

-   contain the minimum amount of code required for the specific change.
    Small patches are easier to review and merge. So, if you're doing
    more than one change (or bug fix), please consider submitting one
    patch per change. Do not collapse multiple changes into a single
    patch. For big changes consider using a patch queue.
-   pass all EXP basic example tests. See **Running tests** below.
-   if you're contributing a feature, especially one that changes a
    public (documented) API, please include the documentation changes
    in the same patch. See **Documentation strategy** below.

# Submitting patches

The best way to submit a patch is to issue a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
on GitHub. The work flow for this is: 

1. Fork the [EXP-code/EXP](https://github.com/EXP-code/EXP) repo in GitHub 
2. Create a branch with the proposed change 
3. Compile and test your changes 
4. Once you are satisfied, create the [pull
request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
on the GitHub EXP code repo

Remember to explain what was fixed or the new functionality (what it
is, why it's needed, etc). The more info you include, the easier will
be for core developers to understand and accept your patch.

You can also discuss the new functionality (or bug fix) before creating
the patch, but it's always good to have a patch ready to illustrate
your arguments and show that you have put some additional thought into
the subject. A good starting point is to send a pull request on GitHub.
It can be simple enough to illustrate your idea, and leave
documentation/tests for later, after the idea has been validated and
proven useful. All functionality (including new features and bug fixes)
must include a test case to check that it works as expected, so please
include tests for your patches if you want them to get accepted sooner.

There might be an existing pull request for the problem you'd like to
solve, so please do take a look at the existing pull request list. For
example, a pull request might be a good start, but changes are
requested by EXP maintainers, and the original pull request author
hasn't had time to address them. In this case consider picking up this
pull request: open a new pull request with all commits from the
original pull request, as well as additional changes to address the
raised issues.  Doing so helps us a lot; it is not considered rude as
long as the original author is acknowledged by keeping his/her
commits.

You can pull an existing pull request to a local branch by running
`git fetch https://github.com/EXP-code/code pull/$PR_NUMBER/head:$BRANCH_NAME_TO_CREATE`
(replace `$PR_NUMBER` with an ID of the pull request, and
`$BRANCH_NAME_TO_CREATE` with a name of the branch you want to create
locally). See also:
<https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/checking-out-pull-requests-locally#modifying-an-inactive-pull-request-locally>.

When writing GitHub pull requests, try to keep titles short but
descriptive. Complete titles make it easy to skim through the issue
tracker.

Finally, we all appreciate improving the code's readability and though
formatting and improved comments. But please, try to keep aesthetic
changes in separate commits from functional changes. This will make pull
requests easier to review and more likely to get merged.

## Adding a Git Commit

All code updates are done by pull request (PR) as described above.
The GitHub EXP-code includes Continuous Integration (CI) support which
can get very chatty and take up unnecessary compute resources. When
your changes only affect documentation (e.g. docstring additions or
software comments) or provide code snippets that you know still need
work, you may add a [no ci] in your commit message. For example: bash

```
> git commit -m "Updated some docstrings [no ci]"
```

When this commit is pushed out to your fork and branch associated with a
pull request, all CI will be skipped.

# Documentation strategy

EXP and pyEXP has three types of documentation:

1.  Inline Doxygen comments in C/C++ class headers. If you have not
    used [Doxgyen](http://doxygen.org) in the past, we recommend that
    you simply copy the style in existing headers in the `include`
    directory in the EXP source tree. In short, Doxygen uses stylized
    comments to extract documentation. Lines that start with `//!` or
    blocks that start with `/**` and end with `*/` will end up
    describing the immediately following class or member function.
2.  Python wrapper code has embedded Python docstrings. For some
    examples, check the C++ code in the `pyEXP`.
3.  The ReadTheDocs manual that you are currently reading is designed to
    provide an overview and tutorial for using EXP/pyEXP. You can fork
    and issue pull requests against the `EXP-code/docs` repo just for
    the EXP source code as described in
	**Submitting-patches** above.

## Contributing Documentation

Our goal is a set of consistent documentation that provides users and
developers a shallow learning curve for using and adding to EXP. For end
users, we strive to write simple step-by-step instructions for common
tasks and give a clear description of the features and capabilities of
the EXP software.

However, it *is* hard to know what everyone needs. As you work with this
package, we would love help with this and encourage all of your
contributions.

This section is an attempt to provide some stylistic guidelines for
documentation writers and developers. For EXP and the documentation
overall, we hope that the existing documentation is a good starting
point. For internal Python documentation in pyEXP, we are trying to
follow the now familiar style of code documentation of both the Astropy
and Numpy projects. In particular, we have adopted the Numpy style
guidelines
[here](https://numpy.org/doc/devdocs/docs/howto_document.html).

## Adding pyEXP docstrings

pyEXP is a set of bindings implemented by
[pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/) and a small amount of
native Python code. It has a full set of docstrings to provide users
with easy access to interactive tips and call signatures. If you would
like to contribute new code, please try to follow the following
guidelines:

-   Please write docstrings for all public classes, methods, and
    functions
-   Please consult the
    [numpydoc](https://numpy.org/doc/devdocs/docs/howto_document.html)
    format from the link above whenever possible
-   We would like to encourage references to internal EXP project links
    in docstrings when useful. This is still a work in progress.
-   Examples and/or tutorials are strongly encouraged for typical
    use-cases of a particular module or class. These can be included in
    the [EXP examples
    repository](https://github.com/EXP-code/EXP-examples) or the [pyEXP
    examples repository](https://github.com/EXP-code/pyEXP-examples)) as
    appropriate.

# Writing examples

We strongly encourage to contribute interesting examples and workflows
to one of the two example repositories:

1.  Use the [EXP examples
    repo](https://github.com/EXP-code/EXP-examples) to illustrate
    simulations. Check the existing ones for guidance. It's best if
    your examples contain sample configuration files and phase-space
    files, or possibly instructions for computing the phase-space files
    if they are large.
2.  Use the [pyEXP examples
    repo](https://github.com/EXP-code/pyEXP-examples). Either documented
    Python or Jupyter notebooks are ideal.

# Running tests

Please check any bug fixes and proposed new functionality works with
existing examples. Here are some suggested guidelines for EXP and pyEXP
changes, respectively:

1.  For EXP, clone the [EXP examples
    repo](https://github.com/EXP-code/EXP-examples) to test changes to
    the EXP simulation code. At the very least, please try the `Nbody`
    example, but please try as many as you can to make sure that your
    change will not break an existing use case for someone else. If your
    change introduces a feature, please try to devise and contribute
    example that demonstrates the new feature. That way, your new
    feature will be tested by all future proposed changes and will help
    others understand how to use your new feature.
2.  The drill for pyEXP is similar. Clone [pyEXP examples
    repo](https://github.com/EXP-code/pyEXP-examples) to test changes to
    the pyEXP N-body analysis code. There are many work flows here, we
    don't expect anyone to try all of them. But please use your best
    judgment to try those affected by your proposed change.
