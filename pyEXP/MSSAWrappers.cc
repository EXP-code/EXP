    "The expMSSA class analyzes and separates the temporal patterns\n"
    "in your coefficients and auxiliary data.  Instances can return\n"
    "coefficient sets for one or more individual patterns that may be\n"
    "used with the FieldGenerator for visualization\n\n"
    "Coefficient update and memory usage\n"
    "-----------------------------------\n"
    "A key feature of MSSA inference is the field generation from\n"
    "the coefficients reconstructed from dominant eigenvalues. After\n"
    "identifying interesting PCs and associated eigenvalues, this\n"
    "is done in 'expMSSA' in two steps:\n"
    "  1. A call to 'reconstruct(list)' with a list of eigenvalue\n"
    "     indices reconstruct the data series and saves those series\n"
    "     to working (possibly detrended) vectors\n"
    "  2 'getReconstructed()' returns a dictionary of name strings that\n"
    "     point to coefficient objects (Coefs). These may be used for\n"
    "     diagnostics (e.g. visualizing fields).\n"
    "The split between the the 'reconstruct()' and the 'getReconstructed()\n"
    "members allows one to examine the detrended series with the selected\n"
    "eigenvalues before updating the coefficient data.  The 'reconstruct()\n"
    "call creates the internal working channel data, leaving the initial\n"
    "coefficient set untouched. The 'getReconstructed()' call replaces the\n"
    "coefficient data in the Coefs object passed to expMSSA, as well as\n"
    "returning a dictionary of name strings and coefficient containers.\n"
    "Subsequent calls to 'getReconstructed' will overwrite the previous\n"
    "updates.  In practice, the coefficients object that you made in Python\n"
    "will always contain the latest updates from the last 'getReconstructed'\n"
    "call.  This allows you to update channels incrementally and the updated\n"
    "copy is available to Python as the originally passed reference.  This\n"
    "strategy prevents your stack from growing very large by efficiently\n"
    "reusing previously allocated storage. If you want to save a copy of\n"
    "the original coefficients, use the 'deepcopy()' member for Coefs\n"
    "before the reconstruction.  The original 'factory' call and each\n"
    "call to 'deepcopy()' will make a new set that will be freed when\n"
    "the reference to the coefficient instance disappears.  This allows\n"
    "some explicit control over your memory use.\n\n"
    "Configuration parameters\n"
    "------------------------\n"
    "expMSSA has a number of internal configuration parameters, listed\n"
    "below. Most people will not need them, but they do exist should\n"
    "you really want to dig in.\n\n"
    "To change the default expMSSA, pass a YAML database of parameters\n"
    "to the expMSSA constructor.  This is a convenient way to have control\n"
    "over some fine-tuning parameters or experimental features without a\n"
    "a change to the API.  They are all optional but a few of these will\n"
    "be useful.  They are all YAML key-value pairs.  The first group\n"
    "below are simple boolean toggles; their presence turns on a feature\n"
    "independent of the value.  The Python script samples show how to\n"
    "construct these simple YAML configurations on the fly. A simple example\n"
    "is also given below.  The boolean parameters are listed below by my\n"
    "guess of their usefulness to most people:\n\n"
    "  verbose: false        Report on internal progress for debugging only\n"
    "  noMean: false         If true, do not subtract the mean when\n"

    "the k-means analyses and similarities of the PC frequency spectra are\n"
    "are ways of diagnosing groups of related components. You may group\n"
    "using 'reconstruct(list)', where 'list' is a Python list of component\n"
    "indices in eigenvalue-PC index order. An empty argument implies no\n"
    "that the will be no PCs in the reconstruction, only the mean values.\n"
    "The two expMSSA steps will often need to be used iteratively.  First,\n"
    "to learn about the primary signals in your data and catagorize the PCs\n"
    "into groups.  Second, a new analysis that provides separation of your\n"
    "main distinct signals into individual reconstructions.\n\n"
    "Save/Restore\n"
    "------------\n"
    "MSSA analyses can be computationally intensive so we include a way\n"
    "to serialize the state to an HDF5 file.  The saveState(prefix) member\n"
    "takes a prefix file parameter and creates the file <prefix>_mssa.h5.\n"
    "You may restore the state by recreating your expMSSA instance with\n"
    "the identical input data and keys and then using restoreState(prefix)\n"
    "to read the MSSA analysis from the HDF5 file.  The restore step will\n"
    "check that your data has the same dimension, same parameters, and key\n"
    "list so it should be pretty hard to fool, but not impossible.\n\n"
    "Computational notes\n"
    "-------------------\n"
    "Some of the linear algebra operations and the MSSA reconstruction\n"
    "can parallelize itself using OpenMP threads.  If your compilter has\n"
    "OpenMP, please enable it (i.e. -fopenmp when compiling in GNU or\n"
    "and set the appropriate environment (e.g. 'export OMP_NUM_THREADS=X'\n"
    "for Bash).  This will be especially useful for the 'reconstruct()'\n"
    "step.  The initial MSSA analysis can also be memory intensive,\n"
    "depending on the size of the time series and the number of channels.\n"
    "One possible strategy is to run the analyses on a larger memory\n"
    "compute node and save the results using the 'saveState()' member to\n"
    "an HDF5 file and reread those files on a local machine using the\n"
    "'restoreState()' member.\n\n";
